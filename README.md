# ALEC 
Amplicon Long-read Error Correction (ALEC) was developed to correct sequencing and alignment errors [insertion/deletions (indels) and substitutions] generated by targeted amplicon sequencing derived from the PacBio RS platform. This script has been validated with full-gene sequencing of the CYP2D6 gene generated by the PacBio RS II platform according to the P6-C4 Pacific Biosciences protocol. Utility of ALEC for other genes was evidenced by a 9.2kb long read sequencing of RYR2 gene with PacBio RS II. ALEC may have utility of other long read sequencing platforms (such as Oxford Nanopore), and/or other sequencing chemistries; however, optimizing the correction parameters would be necessary to achieve ideal sequence correction and output for genes and sequencing platforms other than those that were validated and noted above. 

Four types of sequencing errors can be corrected after applying ALEC: 1) random substitutions; 2) random indels; 3) indels within homopolymers; and 4) indels near sequence variants.
 
## System requirements
* Python 2.7.10 or above   
* Don't support Python 3 
* pysam
* numpy

## Usage
The ALEC script takes a fasta file as a reference file and a SAM/BAM file as the raw data alignment file, and automatically generates a corrected fasta file as output in the working directory. The usage of the script is as below:

Python ALEC.py -r reference.fasta -i input.bam\/sam [arguments] 


### Arguments Table

|Argument|Type|Default|Description|
|:-----|:---:|:---:|:---|
|--input <br/>   -i	| string	| NA	| Required. Input file, SAM or BAM. |
|-- reference<br/> -r|string|	NA	|Required. Reference file, FASTA file, index it following Samtools manual| 
|--targetRegion<br/> -t|	string|	NA	|Required. Target region interval. Example: 1:300000-400000|
|--lengthFilter<br/> -lf	|float|	0.001|	Optional. Reads shorter than lengthFilter * length(targetRegion)<br/> will be excluded in this correction process.|
|--downsample<br/>	-ds|	float|	1.0|	Optional. Fraction of down sampling. |
|--deletion<br/> -del|	float|	0.0	|Required. Deletion error frequency threshold (per base) to trigger correction.|
|--insert<br/> -ins|	float|	0.0|	Required. Insert error frequency threshold (per base) to trigger correction.|
|--mismatch<br/> -mis|	float	|0.0|	Required. Substitution error frequency threshold (per base) to trigger correction.|
|--del_homo_p<br/>-del_hp |	float	|0.0|	Required. Deletion Homopolymer Penalty.|
|--ins_homo_p<br/> -ins_hp |	float	|0.0|	Optional. Insert Homopolymer Penalty.|

## Note
1. The script only takes one single sequence as reference each time. Please use the same reference file as used in alignment. 
2. We do not have a preference regarding the available sequence alignment tools; however, we used alignment files generated with BWA-MEM (0.7.12) to develop the ALEC script (see reference below for details). Files from other alignment tool could lead to unexpected performance.
